# Smart Energy Monitoring with AI

This project aims to monitor power consumption data
and apply machine learning to predict energy usage
and detect abnormal patterns.

Tech Stack:
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
## Dataset Description

The dataset contains daily power consumption parameters such as:
- Voltage (V)
- Current (A)
- Power (W)

This data will be used to train machine learning models
for energy usage prediction and anomaly detection.
## Current Progress
- Project structure created
- Dataset loaded using Python
- Modular code setup for future ML pipeline
